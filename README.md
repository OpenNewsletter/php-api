# Nemesis API Example - Newsletter #

Here is an example of a JSON REST API built on [Nemesis Framework](https://github.com/kimihub/nemesis-framework).

This API hasn't any user interface. To test it, simply deploy it on a PaaS like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/) and use a browser extension such as [RESTClient](http://restclient.net/) or [Postman](https://getpostman.com) to build requests.

Keep in mind that is just a demo or a skeleton for a Nemesis Api, its stability in production has not been tested.
